I'm passionate about applying Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence to scientific domains, with a focus on Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics. Now I am a CTO, Co-Founder @ [Deep MedChem](https://deepmedchem.com/) and exploring innovative AI applications in drug discovery and medical chemistry.

### Public Projects

#### 🌟 Featured

* [Chemical Embeddings Search Engine](https://cheese-new.deepmedchem.com/) – Custom implemented disk-based vector database with 40B+ isometric embeddings of molecules trained using novel AI approach. The UI is written in React/Typescript, Vite, Express and Tailwind CSS. [Read paper preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/67250915f9980725cfcd1f6f)

#### 🍱 Miscellaneous

* [DOI Reference Extractor](https://github.com/mireklzicar/doi-reference-extractor) @ [references.mireklzicar.com](https://references.mireklzicar.com/) – Enter a DOI to extract and download all references in your preferred citation format
* [DNGPU Torch](https://github.com/mireklzicar/dngpu_torch) – Torch implementation of Neural GPU with Diagonal Recurrent Cells
* [Ketcher Docker](https://github.com/mireklzicar/ketcher-docker) @ [ketcher.mireklzicar.com](https://ketcher.mireklzicar.com/) – A production-ready Vite-based application that embeds the Ketcher chemical structure editor with full iframe communication support.
* [Issue Duration Labeller – Github Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issue-duration-labeler) – Github Action for automatic labelling of issues based on time taken
* [LineIndex](https://github.com/mireklzicar/lineindex) – LineIndex provides lightning-fast random access to lines in large text files through efficient indexing. It's a pip package designed to handle very large files where you need to frequently access specific lines without reading the entire file.
* [ESP and RESP partial charges](https://electrostatics.deepmedchem.com/) – Streamlit app of computation of near DFT-quality ESP and RESP partial charges
* [Modeller](https://modeller.deepmedchem.com/) – Streamlit app allowing users to train custom AI models for ADMET property prediction and run inference at scale unmatched by competitors
* [Spanning Trees Search](https://github.com/mireklzicar/Spanning-trees-search) – Python project leveraging matrix methods in graph theory to efficiently enumerate spanning trees.
* [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/mireklzicar/Particle-Swarm-Optimization) – C# project for visualisation of particle swarm optimization.
* [Time Resolved X-ray Diffraction Crystallography](https://github.com/mireklzicar/Time-resolved-X-ray-diffraction-crystallography) – Work for ELI Beamlines under research group TREX at Department of Structural Dynamics
